Lifelab
=======

A random saturday morning idea - The game of life, but with a lot more rules.

Life forms can be plants or animals, and animals can be herbivores, omnivores, or carnivores.

Carnivores can be scavengers or predators.

When compatible lifeforms cross, they can reproduce.  The new life will have the same core traits,
as those need to be the same for reproduction to be possible, but all other stats will be randomly 
selected from each parent per stat.
